    "# Thompson's Construction Algorithm\n",
    "> Thompson's Algorithm is the method of converting a regular expression to a NFA (Non-deterministic Finite Automota. The algorithm was created by Ken Thompson who also created the Unix operating system and the B programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Thompson is a pioneer of Computer Science, and is respected worldwide by the community.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Epsilon\n",
    "> The empty expression ε (epsilon) is considered the 5th letter of the Greek alphabet. The epsilon represents empty or Null symbols.\n",
    "##### (ε)\n",
    "![epsilon](EPSILON.png)\n",
    "### Union Expression\n",
    "> Any state getting any input can visit any of the two specified states or it could also chose to visit no state. The null state option can also lead to a state with a value or accept state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concatenation Expression\n",
    "> The joining of two string lists \n",
    "````\n",
    "X ={x,xx,xy} -  Always start with 'x'\n",
    "Y = {y,xy,yy} - Always end with 'y'\n",
    "X.Y = {xy,xxy,xxy, xyy, ....}\n",
    "````\n",
    "> All strings above must begin with 'x' and end with 'y'. This means the start state must start with 'x' and accept state must end with a 'y'.\n",
