    "# Shunting Yard Algorithm\n",
    "For our Graph Theory prject we are advised to use the shunting yard algorithm. The shunting yard algorithm is essentially a method of parsing a mathematical expression in infix notation and producing a profix notation string as a result. \n",
    "\n",
    "### When shunting there are a few requirements :\n",
    "* Infix notation - The string that is being tested\n",
    "* Stack list - This can be initialised as an empty list, later for data to be stored inside.\n",
    "* Queue list - This will also be an empty list. (Act as our output in the end)\n",
    "* Pecedences - Operators will be granted greater precedence than otherts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### List Methods\n",
    "The list methods that we will be using within the shunting yard algorthm will be :\n",
    ">##### Pop()\n",
    ">##### Append()\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pop()\n",
    "Pop removes elements at specified positions when specified. If it is not specified it removes the last element."
